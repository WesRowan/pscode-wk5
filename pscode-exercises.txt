Calculate the sum of two numbers

START
Enter the sum of two integer variable
Enter first number
Enter second number
Sum= first number+second number
Print sum
End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Start
If number % 2=0
Print number is even
Else print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Start
Input 5 numbers
Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5

Avg=(n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5

If n1>n2, n3, n4, n5
Max= n1
Else if n2>n1, n3, n4, n5
Max=n2 
Else if n3>n1, n2, n4, n5
Max=n3
Else if n4>n1, n2, n3, n5
Max=n4
Else if n5>n1, n2, n3, n4
Max=n5

If n1<n2, n3, n4, n5
min=n1
Else if n2<n1,n3,n4,n5
Min= n2
If n3<n1,n2,n4,n5
Min=n3
Else If n4<n1,n2,n3,n5
Min=n4
Else if n4<n1,n2,n4,n4
Min=n5

Print "The average of five numbers is:Avg"

Print "The smallest number among five numbers is:Min"

Print "The largest number among five numbers is:Max"
